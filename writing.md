Surprise! This whole website is actually a ploy to get you interested in my writing! And it worked, I tell you! It worked! Mwa ha ha ha - ah-hem...

Sorry about that... but yes, it's true. I'm a writer and I want you to know it! To date I've written five novels all in different states of completion which I hope I can share with you at some point. Obviously I'm aiming for publication and having a platform is a huge part of that nowadays, which is why I've built this website. Of course, I knew I couldn't just build a website and I want to give something back to you, which is why I've included, and will continue to add, articles on my research and anything else I can think of in future.

It would be a huge help if you would subscribe to my newsletter which will keep you updated about any cool stuff I add to the site as well as my work.
