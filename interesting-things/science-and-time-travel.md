### In my book The Day Time Was Lost two friends, Su-hwa and Leo, travel through time to different parts of the world looking for answers.

What happened on ‘the day time was lost’? How does somebody even lose time? And why are they being chased by a mysterious old woman and her henchmen? The answers they uncover are enough to shatter their understanding of time, space and their own existence forever!​

When writing The Day Time Was Lost I was inspired by real life theoretical physics and how at times it can feel utterly mind-boggling for someone new to it. Proven theories that sound like pure sci-fi inform our understanding of the universe while at the same time making it feel magical and awesome.

Soon, I hope to post some articles on the research I did for this book and some of the things that amazed, interested and inspired me.
